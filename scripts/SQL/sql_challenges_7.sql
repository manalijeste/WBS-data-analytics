In the exercises below you will need to use the following clauses:
    - GROUP BY
    - HAVING

/*******************************************************************************
GROUP BY

*******************************************************************************/

-- 1. Find the total amount of authors for each state

SELECT COUNT(au_id), state
FROM authors
GROUP BY state;

/* 2. Find the total amount of authors by each state and order them in 
    descending order */

SELECT COUNT(au_id), state
FROM authors
GROUP BY state ORDER BY COUNT(au_id) DESC;

-- 3. What's the price of the most expensive title from each publisher?

SELECT MAX(price), pub_id
FROM titles
GROUP BY pub_id; 
 
-- 4. Find out the top 3 stores with the most sales

SELECT SUM(qty), stor_id
FROM sales
GROUP BY stor_id 
ORDER BY SUM(qty) DESC LIMIT 3;


/* 5. Find the average job level for each job_id from the employees table.
    Order the jobs in ascending order by its average job level. */

SELECT AVG(job_lvl), job_id
FROM employee
GROUP BY job_id
ORDER BY AVG(job_lvl);

/* 6. For each type (business, psychology…), find out how many books each
    publisher has. */

SELECT COUNT(pub_id), type, COUNT(title_id)
FROM titles
GROUP BY type, pub_id;

/* 7. Add the average price of each publisher - book type combination from your
   previous query */

SELECT COUNT(pub_id), type, COUNT(title_id), AVG(price) 
FROM titles
GROUP BY type, pub_id;

/*******************************************************************************
HAVING

*******************************************************************************/

/* 8. From your previous query, keep only the combinations of publisher - book
   type with an average price higher than 12 */

SELECT COUNT(pub_id), type, COUNT(title_id), AVG(price) 
FROM titles
GROUP BY type, pub_id
HAVING AVG(price)>12;

/* 9. Order the results of your previous query by these two criteria:
      1. Count of books, descendingly
      2. Average price, descendingly */

SELECT COUNT(pub_id), type, COUNT(title_id), AVG(price) 
FROM titles
GROUP BY type, pub_id
HAVING AVG(price)>12
ORDER BY Count(type) DESC, AVG(price) DESC;

/* 10. Some authors have a contract, while others don't - it's indicated in the
     "contract" column of the authors table.
     
     Select all the states and cities where there are 2 or more contracts 
     overall */

SELECT state, city, SUM(contract)
FROM authors
GROUP BY state, city
HAVING SUM(contract)>=2;

/* 
The main difference between WHERE and HAVING is that:
    - the WHERE clause is used to specify a condition for filtering most records
    - the HAVING clause is used to specify a condition for filtering values from 
      an aggregate (such as MAX(), AVG(), COUNT() etc...)
